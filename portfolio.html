    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am currently a second year student in <strong>Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology</strong> (JKUAT).</p>

    <p>At the moment I am partaking in a short course on programming at <strong>Moringa School</strong>.<a href="https://moringaschool.com/"></a></p>
    <p>I decided to take a class on programming because I have always been interested in the mechanics of <em>how things work</em>.</p>
    <p>Engineering will help me understand the <em>hardware</em> aspect of it while programming will help me understand the <em>software</em> aspect.</p>
