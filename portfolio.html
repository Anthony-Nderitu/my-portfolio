      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I am currently a second year student in Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT).</p>
      <p>I study Electrical and Electronic Engineering.</p>
      <p>At the moment im partaking in a short course on programming at Moringa School.<a href="https://moringaschool.com/"></a></p>
      <p>I decided to take a class on programming because ive always been interested in the mechanics of how things work.</p>
      <p>Engineering will help me understand the hardware aspect of it while programming will help me understand the software aspect.</p>
      <p>I have done some sessions of internship at a company called In-Vitro Diagnostics (EA) Limited.<a href="http://www.in-vitro.co.ke/"></a></p>
